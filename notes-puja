- Always peace and love and relationship is above everything
- Last puja they used not Mother's feet but Paduka instead. This is kinda fine but we have to let people know to use the pic.
  It can happen if someone new comes and all that but it's also not so good to tell people what to do. Doing puja to Mother's shoe is
  probably not the best idea. Now that we have the Photos, it's proper to worship the Photos.
  So there has to be some communication about this that we should use the Photos because that is closest we have to the Goddess.
- We should have basic guidelines that others can follow and process it. We should write these down and comminucate it with the yogis.
- People leading the Puja should have a little bit of confidence and knowledge about how to do the Puja.
- The seven-ish ladies that come for the Puja should actually concentrate on the Puja and do the Puja and not actually go around and bring things.
  The role of the pujari is to bring the offerings and help out so that ladies doing the Puja can actuall concentrate.
- A little break in the music during the Puja so that we have a bit of silence.
- Less volume during the music. Mics are too loud!
- There is no need to do a huge Puja for small events like Holi. Have to be careful to not get too ritualistic.
- If the vibrations are not good or people can't go deep, it feels long.
- Always to children come up for the Puja because sometimes it takes quite long. Maybe sometimes Yuvas shouldn't come for Shri Ganesha Puja.
- The person leading the Puja should have all the freedom (within the guidelines) to do what they need to do.
- I feel like men should get more involved in doing the Pujas (setup, Puja itself, cleanup etc.)
- The Pujaris should ensure that everything is taken care of including cleaning and packing up of the silver. The Puja team should take care of
  cleaning everything.
- Can't just walk into the room of Shri Mataji. There has to be a valid reason to come in and do something.
- The Puja team can do how they want but they should have an undersatnding of what they are doing and have a bit of a humility about the whole thing.
  Never go alone in Mother's bedroom and have to be very careful in being respectful. At events where many people are present we can communicate these
  points about respect to people.
- Talk about the Puja at the seminar
- Don't pause Mother's talk to translate or commentate.
- Look in the drawer before buying new honey or ghee or something. Take back what you don't use! Don't leave open packets around.
  The ghee should probably be made at home for Puja anyway.
- The Puja team also includes havan. Many Yogis say that they want to do a havan before a Puja.
- The Puja team should be known so that people know who is who.
- How to involve the regional Yogis? Maybe give a Puja to each state.
- Possibly have a backdrop or even decoration team to take care of backdrop and all those things.
- Everyone should feel welcome and not restricted
