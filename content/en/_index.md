## Auspicious Days

{{% details title="❇️ Holi - 3 March" closed="true" %}}

> As you know, on the day of Holi, Holika was burnt. Agni [the God of fire]
  had a very big blessing and task, because Agni Devata had given Holika a boon
  that in any circumstance, she will not burn, that death could come to her
  in any form, but not by fire. And after giving this boon, he regretted a lot
  because she took Holika in her lap and sat in the fire. And Agni Devata had a big dilemma,
  that “I have given this promise to her, that I will not burn her and how can I
  fulfil this promise? And Prahlad, is Himself innocence personified, He is himself
  an incarnation of Shri Ganesha and how can I burn Him? Nobody can burn him.
  And He is also beyond my powers. He is formed from my power.” So, he thought,
  “What is this ego?” that in front of such a great power what can I talk about my power?
  I have no such power which can face Him. His power is so great that I
  cannot burn him whatsoever I may try. But at this time I have a very big
  dilemma in front of me”. So, in between “duty” and “dharma” the dilemma is in between these two.
  In this situation we must understand that dharma is higher than duty.
  The duty of dharma is higher than a normal duty and even higher is the dharma of the Atma
  (Spirit). It means that the one with a smaller importance, whatever could be the
  importance of our goal, the goal which is higher, which has a higher importance,
  if you have to achieve it, then the smaller goal must be given up.

{{% details title="🌷 Gudi Padwa - 19 March" closed="true" %}}

> Today is the Day of Gudi Padwa [The New Year’s Day of the Shalivahana shak].
  And it is celebrated in Maharashtra mostly, but now in other places too.
  It is said that it is a very auspicious day. Whatever work is done on that day it is fruitful.
  But whatever is the reason is as per worldly beliefs. The other thing is that,
  in the dynasty of Shalivahana, there was one person: Babruvahan. He defeated the
  king Vikramaditya. After that, he started this new calendar called ‘Shalivahana Shak’.
  According to this calender, today is the first day [of the year]. Its importance is
  major in Maharashtra. To represent the Shalivahanas, they take a Kumbha [and a stick]
  on which they put a shawl – he was Shalivahana. The Kumbha represents the Kundalini.
  They tie a shawl [to the stick] and keep a Kumbha on top of it. The meaning is
  that the Kumbha also represents spirituality. Spirituality is represented by the Kumbha.
  The Shalivahanas used to call themselves the seven vehicles. They had a lot of faith
  in Kundalini. Later, they started giving a shawl to the Devi. They were worshipers
  of the Devi so they called themselves the Shalivahanas. That is how the name got changed.

{{% details title="🏹 Rama Navami - 26 March" closed="true" %}}

The celebration of Shri Rama's birth.

> Now in the Treta Yuga when Shri Rama came, the idea of kingship and rulership started.
  So, the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people. The people had to have goodwill:
  for the people and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity.
  The will, that is the Right Side. So how to create the goodwill in people?
  First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go in sacrificing to keep
  the moral and the goodwill of the people. So the Right Side was created by the advent
  of Shri Rama because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness that
  they should be ruled, that they should not be anarchist, there should be one head
  who should be able to organise, co-ordinate and work out a collective thing.

{{% details title="🌚 Mahavir Jayanti - 31 March" closed="true" %}}

The celebration of Shri Mahavira's birth.

> It is being said that today is Mahavir Jayanti. It is a very auspicious day.
  Shri Mahavira rules our Ida nadi. And all the good and bad conditionings
  that are within us, are corrected by Him. And he has described Hell, explained about it,
  what hell is. When man goes to hell, what happens to him, and what is his plight.
  And He has explained very intensely. Buddha and Mahavira, were both contemporary,
  and both of them spent a life of penance. Both of them were princes. And despite that
  they put themselves through great penance and meditation, and understood that when
  man makes mistakes, and goes to the left side, then how he goes down to hell and
  what is his plight. We have to suffer hell in this world only. Even before his death,
  man can experience it, if he is very sinful and goes on committing sins, does
  not stay away from it, and does not even realise that this is wrong.
  So in these modern times, such people are getting destroyed by themselves from inside.
  For that there is no external force needed. Because, their level of foolishness is so high,
  that they themselves have arranged to destroy themselves.
  Sometimes they also think that they are quite perfect and who can harm them,
  there are many like that. All such people are going to be destroyed in this Satyayuga.
  Not only that, all those who are not able to rise above the human level,
  nobody knows how many of them will be able to live in this world.
  Because so many demonic forces have now become active, and they attract human beings
  in such a way, that they are getting caught in it in such a way that it is very
  difficult to escape from that trough. Sahaja Yoga is the only way through which
  we can come out of this swamp, and take ourselves to a higher state.
  We can also pull out many others with us and transform their lives.

{{% details title="🐒 Hanuman Jayanti - 2 April" closed="true" %}}

The celebration of Shri Hanumana's birth.

> Today we are celebrating Jayanti [birth anniversary] of Hanumanji.
  What should we say about Hanumanji? He was so powerful and wise.
  He was equally devoted and dedicated. Generally such a powerful person becomes right-sided.
  He considers himself so dignified that he doesn’t give any importance to
  anyone in his comparison. But Hanumanji is a special deity.
  A special deity full of qualities that, as much strong He was,
  as much powerful He was, as much was His devotion. An embodiment of balanced strength,
  He had as much power as He had devotion. How did He maintain this balance?
  And was steady in it is worth understanding in Sahaja Yoga.
  When we are enlightened and in Sahaja Yoga, we get many powers simultaneously:
  we get balance, we love others. With love and with the help of the power of love,
  we get busy in our work and go on doing our work. In this way,
  Shri Hanumanji was very powerful. He had Divine powers; He had Navadha [special] powers,
  which are called Garima Laghuma. He could become as big as He wanted to be
  or as minute as He wanted to be and as small as an atom. All these powers He
  got through His devotion. It means that devotion and power are both the same.
  He who has power and doesn’t have devotion, becomes a rakshasa. [demon]
  And he who has devotion but doesn’t have power, becomes mad. Between both these,
  he who is in the central path attains this state, which you may call power, or devotion.
  Each part of His body is made of that. Because of His, this special feature,
  today we worship Bajrangbali in our motherland, as well as in foreign countries.
  I am so surprised that the young boys, children of foreign countries,
  when they draw any picture, first of all they draw Hanumanji’s picture.
  Next, His special quality was that He was half man and half monkey.
  Means, it was a perfect combination of animal and human being.

{{% details title="🌳 Buddha Purnima - 24 May" closed="true" %}}

The celebration of Shri Buddha's birth.

> As you know Buddha was a son of a king. And one day He was shocked to see a very poor man,
  thin man, walking on the street, very unhappy person, and He felt very sad about it.
  Then He saw one person who was very sick and about to die. Then He saw a man who was
  dead and people were carrying him to the cremation ground. This all upset Him very
  much and He started thinking about it and seeking what is the reason for all these happenings
  in human beings. Firstly, why do they become so miserable or sick, or, why do they die
  so miserably? The reason He found out in His search. He went round the whole world,
  I should say, in the sense: He read Upanishads, He read … went to many gurus, went to many
  places of spiritual education, Benares, everywhere He went. And ultimately,
  He was sitting under a banyan tree when suddenly His kundalini was awakened by
  Adi Shakti and He got His realization. Then He realized that the reason for all this is the desire.

{{% details title="🕯️ Guru Purnima - 29 July" closed="true" %}}

> This is the only thing that you can give to God, is to become the instruments of God,
  complete surrendering yourself to Him, so that, this world of yours, this universe of yours,
  because I do not belong to any universe or any creation whatsoever,
  it does not matter with Me if this creation is gone or  lives.  It is for you people.
  It is only for you that you have to have this creation, and so, [the]
  only thing that you  can do is to give  Me the assurance, that  I should see
  that by creating this universe and by this world, God has not gone wrong,
  and by giving you Realization, I have not gone wrong because you are going to
  help in the complete emancipation of [the] humanity.  This is what Guru Purnima is.
  When you think on those lines immediately you know what you should do
  for the next Guru Purnima, you have to plan it now.

{{% details title="👑 Dassera - 20 October" closed="true" %}}

> Today we are celebrating in Switzerland the coronation of Shri Rama on Dassera Day.
  Many things happened on Dassera Day. The most important was that Shri Rama was
  coronated as a king on this day. He also killed Ravana on this day.
  Many may say that how can it be He killed Ravana and He was coronated on the same date?
  In those days in India, we had supersonic aeroplanes and, is a fact, and the aeroplane’s
  name was Pushpak, meaning the flower. It was called as Pushpak and it has a tremendous speed.
  So after killing Ravana He came to Ayodhya with His wife and that was the day He was crowned.
  On the ninth day, He worshiped the Goddess to get strength, Shakti, for his weapons,
  and the tenth day He killed Ravana. So, you can imagine how much advanced people were
  there at the time of Shri Rama and His kingdom. The reason was the king was an incarnation;
  also He was a benevolent king as described by Socrates.

{{% details title="🪢 Bhai Dooj - 11 Nov" closed="true" %}}

Bhai Dooj (Also known as, Bhai Tika, Bhaubeej, Bhai Beej, Bhai Phonta or Bhratri Dwitiya)
is a festival celebrated on the second lunar day of the Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight)
of Kartika, the eighth month of the Shalivahana Shaka calendar. It is celebrated during
the Diwali or Tihar festival and Holi festival. The celebrations of this day are
similar to the festival of Raksha Bandhan.

On the day of the festival, sisters invite their brothers for a sumptuous meal often
including their favourite dishes/sweets. The whole ceremony signifies the duty of a
brother to protect his sister, as well as a sister's blessings for her brother.

{{% details title="🪯 Guru Nanak Jayanti - 24 Nov" closed="true" %}}

The celebration of Shri Guru Nanak's birth.

> When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and Muslims were fighting,
  so he started his theme with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim are both the same,
  and how can you differentiate between the two?” All their theme was like this,
  of integration of these two main religions which existed in India. That time, there
  was no question of giving Realisation. People were trying to defend their faiths
  and fight each other and kill each other. Imagine! Created by the same Spirit!
  Fighting among themselves! How silly it must be, and absurd.
  In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that he was Mohammed. Once,
  he was lying down and his feet were towards Mecca. So people said,
  “How can you put your feet towards Mecca?” He had Muslim disciples and also
  Hindu disciples. He said, “Alright, whichever way you say, I’ll put my feet.”
  He turned round his feet. They said, “Still you are towards Mecca.” He went
  round and round and round [but] still they saw him facing Mecca! And they
  could not understand how it was that he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,
  that Mecca was at his lotus feet. Same with Mohammed.
