Protocl 

- When going to Mother's room for prep do not go alone marching. Go in a team witha specific purpose. Ask for permission and start doing whatever you do
- before coming to puja clean yourself a bit
- Specially when going to Mother's bedroom only go when absolutely necessary. We don't talk all the time there. Keep quite and attention on Sahasrara and just do the work and come out
- Puja team should take care of everything from beggining to the end. That includes Silver putting back and taking back all the left overs (Amtrut etc.) Don't leave half packet of Suagr etc here.
  They ask the puja team for help. Leave the meditation hall in the same format as you came. Team who takes care of the puja should have someone until the end to make sure that things are clean.
  After the Puja we should not leave a mess. It's a collective duty and everyone should help. Would be nice to take the rubish out as well. Also puja team should take care of the flower, decoration.
  More people should get involved in preparing the flower. Get nice flower but not necesasrily a lot. Wednesday and Saturday people should come to refresh the flowers (this is in the blessings list).
  After the pujas it is needed to clean the flowers after the Puja. We should maybe reduce the flowers. There are too many! it is better to put money on the flower offering rather than brining a million
  vases. We don't need to buy ready-made prasad. We don't need a ton of things. Bring something handmade or nutes or something small. Don't bring too much chocolate unless maybe it's easter. Put the momey
  in the box instead. Bring small portions of Prasad. homemade or some nuts and fruits.
- The Pujari should come for prep and also stay for the cleanup. If you hold the mic, you have to stay there all the time! When you are Pujari, you need to be confirdent enough to guide and lead the puja
  organizing team. If pujari is always there he/she also knows where is what and how to find things.
- Beofre the Puja starts, the organzing team of the puja selects a few people to invite Mother for the puja.
- The puja only done on Mother's Feet. Paduka is used for putting ornaments etc. but not for the Puja. Amrut should be offered properly one after the other.
- A humble small offering doesn't need to include all the steps. Humble offering is basically a small Puja. Pujas don't have to go for 5 huors. Puja organizing team can figure out how long or full they want
  the puja to be.
- No citrus fruite or banana to be offered to Shri Mataji during the Puja and havan
- Merigold flower should not be offered. Karneshain (nelke) should not be offered. Orchid also not.
- In navaratri we should do a Havan at least once.
- In cold period we could do national Havan in Stockerei.
- attach a PDF for what puja protocol is. 
- It's always nice to do a havan before Puja.
- Havan Samagri should eb raw rice mixed. for havan we need something sweet. Just a little bit sweet rice (like rice pudding or kir) should be there and offered at the end. Otherwise honey or sugar. so
  something sweet should be offered at the end. With deities name you say AUM Swaha but with negativity you jsut say Swaha. Offer ghee during the havan. Honey also during.
  Fruts are flexible but coconut must be there. Put the coconut last.
- When there is no moon, we dont do puja. This is Amavasya. Only Diwali during Amavasya is allowed.
- Puja team decides what time should the Puja happen
- attention during the puja and not on all the action. The Puja will be there to give you what you need, if you need it.
  The ladies doing the Puja don't need to worry about if something is coming or not. They should put their attention on the Puja and not on what's happening or what should be offered.
- The kumba must be prepared for the puja. The old ones should be placed in the pot in the kitchen. The old flowers that are offered to Mother and rice and everything is placed
  in the black bin.
- Don't Pause Mother's talk in the middle of the talk to translate
- Deending on the Puja, the organizing team can offer a tali for food for Shri Mataji
- Before Havan we don't need to do a full Puja.
